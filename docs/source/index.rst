Network traffic monitoring techinques using Machine Learning
============================================================

Welcome. This is a collection of resources that can help one start with using Machine Learning in the field of Network Traffic Analysis. We hope that people find this resource useful. We provide explanations and code of some of the popular ML and DL algorithms in order to provide readers with inspiration on how to use such models in our domain. The documentation is layed out as follows:

.. datasets/gen_dataset
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

   notebooks/analysis3
   notebooks/analysis_rnn
